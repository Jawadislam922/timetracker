/**
 * Safety net for forgotten clock-outs.
 *
 * The desktop/web clock is fully manual — it only records the action the user
 * presses. If someone clocks in and never clocks out (closed the app, slept the
 * laptop, or simply forgot), the clock-in hangs open forever: they read as
 * "Working" indefinitely and the day never closes. This closes those dangling
 * clock-ins and, crucially, writes a real clock_out entry with a plain-language
 * REASON, so the Activity log always shows the pair and why it was auto-closed.
 *
 * A clock-out time is never invented out of thin air — it is chosen, in order:
 *   1. Tracker went idle: the tracker sent its last heartbeat >= idle-hours ago
 *      -> clock out at that last activity. (Credits only time they were active.)
 *   2. Never tracked (e.g. executives who don't run the tracker): once the
 *      clock-in is older than cap-hours -> clock out at clock-in + cap.
 * Either way the clock-out never runs past cap-hours, so there are no 60-hour
 * ghosts. A session whose tracker is still alive (idle < idle-hours) is left
 * alone — we never cut off someone who is genuinely mid-shift.
