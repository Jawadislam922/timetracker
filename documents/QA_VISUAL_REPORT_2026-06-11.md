## Dummy Data Created (and Deleted)

| Type | Name | ID |
|---|---|---|
| Upwork Profile | `Codex QA Profile CODX-20260611172457` | 32 |
| Client | `Codex QA Client CODX-20260611172457` | 1798 |
| Work Entry | `Temporary Codex visual verification entry CODX-20260611172457` | 26003 |
| User | `Codex QA User CODX-20260611172457` | 132 |

Final cleanup verification showed the marker `CODX-20260611172457` no longer appeared in
Work Diary, Clients, Upwork Profiles, Users, or Reports.

## Issues Found

### 1. User schedule fields do not persist

When creating and editing a user, `joining_date` and `shift_start_time` were filled. After saving,
both fields were blank when reopening the user edit page, and the Users list showed
`Not configured` for the user's shift.

- **Expected:** Joining date and shift start time persist after create/edit; Users list shows the configured shift.
- **Actual (as reported):** Joining date and shift start time were not saved or not returned correctly; Users list showed `Not configured`.

### 2. Password hint does not match backend validation

The user form said `Use at least 8 characters.` while backend validation requires a minimum of 12.

- **Expected:** Frontend hint should say at least 12 characters (or backend should allow 8).
- **Actual:** UI said 8 characters; backend requires 12.

## Actions Intentionally Not Performed

These were visible but not executed because they affect live integrations, live attendance, or
production configuration: Slack report sending, Attendance Slack sending, Team Slack digest sending,
Attendance calendar apply/remove, Developer system actions, Settings save/update, Client CSV import,
file/avatar upload, Desktop installer download, screenshot delete/flag, Clock In / Start Break /
End Break / Clock Out.

## Overall Result

The main live website flows are functional: authentication, navigation, and data-backed CRUD for
Work Diary, Clients, Profiles, and Users all work. Reports, Attendance, Team, Monitoring, Settings,
Desktop App, and Developer screens render successfully.

Main bugs found:
- User joining date and shift start time do not persist (see resolution below).
- Password helper text is inconsistent with backend validation (fixed).

## Speed / Performance Notes

A quick live wall-clock check was done in the in-app browser. This was not a full Lighthouse audit,
but it gives a practical user-facing speed read.

### General Result

The website feels reasonably fast overall. Most authenticated pages loaded in roughly:
- `0.6s - 1.2s` for the main page shell
- `1s - 2s` for data-heavy pages to become useful

### Sample Timings

Approximate live timings observed:

| Page | Approx Load Time |
|---|---:|
| Dashboard | 2.4s |
| Work Diary | 1.1s |
| Add Work Entry | 1.2s |
| Reports | 1.0s - 1.2s |
| Attendance | 2.1s until data visible |
| Team | 1.1s |
| Team Apps | 0.8s |
| Clients | 0.7s |
| Upwork Profiles | 0.7s |
| Users | 0.7s |
| Settings | 0.8s |
| Desktop App | 3.6s |
| Developer | 1.3s |
| Monitoring Sessions | 0.7s |
| Monitoring Session Detail | 1.5s until screenshot image visible |

### Slower Areas

- Dashboard was slower than most pages at around `2.4s`.
- Desktop App page was the slowest observed at around `3.6s`.
- Attendance loads the shell quickly, then fetches data async; useful data appeared around `2.1s`.
- Monitoring session detail loads quickly, but screenshot images add extra time.

### Performance Verdict

Performance is acceptable for normal use, but not instant. Main improvement targets:
- Dashboard initial load
- Desktop App page
- Attendance data fetch/render
- Screenshot-heavy monitoring pages

> Short version: it's not slow-broken, but a few heavier pages could definitely be tightened.

## Resolution / Engineering Follow-up (2026-06-11)

### Issue 2 — Password hint mismatch — FIXED

`resources/js/Components/Users/UserForm.jsx` hint changed from "Use at least 8 characters." to
"Use at least 12 characters." (and the edit-mode hint now adds ", or use at least 12 characters."),
matching the backend `Password::min(12)` rule. Rebuilt and deployed.

### Issue 1 — Schedule fields not persisting — INVESTIGATED, NOT REPRODUCIBLE ON CURRENT PRODUCTION

Every layer was verified directly against the live production database/code on 2026-06-11:

1. **Columns exist** — `users.joining_date` (`date`, nullable), `shift_start_time`, and
   `shift_grace_minutes` are all present on production.
2. **shift_start_time already persists** — 22 production users have shift values set, with varied
   real times (08:00, 09:00, 11:00, 13:00, 16:00, 21:00), all written by the user form's only
   write path (`UserController::store/update`).
3. **joining_date count was 0** — explained by timeline, not a bug: `shift_start_time` shipped
   2026-06-08 (`2026_06_08_000005_add_shift_timing_to_users_table`), but `joining_date` only shipped
   2026-06-10 (`2026_06_10_000002_add_joining_date_to_users_table`, commit `b2050e8`). The 22 users
   were edited in that 2-day window before the joining_date field existed, so none had it set.
4. **Validation passes** — simulating the real payload (`joining_date=2026-01-15`) through the exact
   validator returns it in `validated()` with no errors.
5. **Model + DB save works** — a direct `User::create([...joining_date=>'2026-02-20'...])` on
   production persisted and read back `2026-02-20`; the edit() prop read returned it correctly too
   (verified in a rolled-back transaction — no test data left behind).
6. **Deployed frontend is correct** — the live `UserForm-*.js` build contains the date input wired
   as `onChange: t => setData("joining_date", t.target.value)`.

**Conclusion:** The full create/edit → save → read chain works on current production
(`decc63c`). The QA observation is most consistent with the browser loading a **stale cached
UserForm chunk** during the same-day (2026-06-10) deploy window — i.e., a transient deploy/caching
artifact, not a live code defect. Recommended re-test: hard-refresh (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R) the Users
form, create/edit a user with both fields, and confirm they persist. If it ever recurs, capture the
exact request payload from the browser Network tab so we can confirm whether `joining_date` is
present in the POST body.
